## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notice - Unsigned Binaries

**Important**: These builds are **not code-signed** (we're an open-source project without budget for certificates). Your operating system will show security warnings when running the app.

### macOS Users
macOS will block the app with "App is damaged and can't be opened." Here's how to bypass:

**Option 1: Remove Quarantine (Recommended)**
```bash
# Navigate to your Downloads folder and run:
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine listonthego_0.1.0_aarch64.dmg
# Then mount the DMG and drag to Applications
```

**Option 2: System Preferences**
1. Try to open the app (it will fail)
2. Go to **System Preferences** ‚Üí **Security & Privacy** ‚Üí **General**
3. Click **"Open Anyway"** next to the ListOnTheGo warning

### Windows Users
Windows Defender SmartScreen will show "Windows protected your PC":

1. Click **"More info"** 
2. Click **"Run anyway"** button
3. The app will install normally

### Linux Users
Most Linux distributions won't block the AppImage or DEB package, but you may need to:
```bash
# Make AppImage executable
chmod +x ListOnTheGo_0.1.0_amd64.AppImage
```

### Alternative: Build It Yourself
If you're uncomfortable with unsigned binaries, you can build from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aruntemme/listonthego.git
cd listonthego
npm install
npm run tauri build
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Quick Setup

### LLM Configuration

2. Configure your preferred LLM provider:
   - **Local**: Default `http://localhost:11434/v1` with `gemma3:4b`
   - **OpenAI**: Add your API key and select model
   - **Custom**: Configure any OpenAI-compatible endpoint

### First Steps

2. **Todos**: Paste text and click "Extract Todos" to see AI magic
3. **Notes**: Create your first note and watch automatic summarization

## üöß Beta Limitations & Known Issues
